## Thread Safety
Four ways to make variable access safe in shared memory concurrency:
○ Confinement : don’t share variables or data between threads.
○ Immutability : make the shared variables unreassignable or the shared data immutable.
○ Threadsafe data type : encapsulate the shared data in an existing threadsafe data type that does the coordination for you.
○ Synchronization : use synchronization to keep the threads from accessing shared variables or data at the same time.

**memoization**:This function stores the answers from previous calls in case they're requested again.

A type is **threadsafe immutable** if it has:
○ no mutator methods
○ all fields declared private and final
○ no representation exposure
○ no mutation whatsoever of mutable objects in the rep
