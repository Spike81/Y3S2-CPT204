## Testing
○ Black box vs White box Testing
○ Unit vs Integration Testing
○ Automated Regression Testing
○ Testing Documents and Coverage

***Black box testing*** means choosing test cases only from the specification, not the implementation of the method.
***White box testing*** (also called glass box testing means choosing test cases with knowledge of how the method is actually implemented.

### Coverage
One way to judge a test suite is to ask how thoroughly it exercises the program, this notion is called ***coverage***.

There are three common kinds of coverage:
○ ***Statement coverage***: is every statement run by some test?
○ ***Branch coverage***: for every if or while statement in the program, are both the true and the false direction taken by some test case?
○ ***Path coverage***: is every possible combination of branches every path through the program taken by some test case?

path coverage > branch coverage > statement coverage

### Unit Testing and Integration Testing
A test that tests an individual module, in isolation if possible, is called a ***unit test***.
The opposite of a unit test is an ***integration test***, which tests a combination of modules, or even the entire program.

***stub*** (or mock object): set up a simulated environment for testing.

### Automated Testing
***Automated testing*** means running the tests and checking their results automatically.

### Regression Testing
Running all your tests after every change is called ***regression testing***.
