representation exposure: code outside the class can modify the representation directly.

immutable wrappers: 
Collections.unmodifiableList() takes a (mutable) List and wraps it with an object that looks like a List , but whose mutators are disabled set()set(), add()add(), remove() throw exceptions.

To make an invariant hold, we need to:
○ make the invariant true in the initial state of the object; and
○ ensure that all changes to the object keep the invariant true.



Translating this in terms of the types of ADT operations, this means:
○ creators and producers must establish the invariant for new object instances; and
○ mutators and observers must preserve the invariant.

observational equality means that two references cannot be distinguished now , in the current state of the program.

Behavioral equality means that two references cannot be distinguished now or in the future, even if a mutator is called to change the state of one object but not the other.
