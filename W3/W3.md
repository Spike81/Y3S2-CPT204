## Coding Rules

● Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
● Comments where needed
● Fail fast
● Avoid magic numbers
● One purpose for each variable
● Use good names
● Don't use global variables
● Return results, don't print them
● Use whitespace for readability

## Testing and bugs

typical residual defect rates: bugs left over after the software has shipped

kloc: one thousand lines of source code



some testings are not good:

Exhaustive testing, Haphazard testing, and Random or statistical testing.



test cases must be chosen systematically
○ A ***test case*** is a particular choice of inputs, along with the expected output behavior required by the specification
○ A ***test suite*** is a set of test cases for an implementation



designing a test suite with three desirable properties:

Correct, Thorough, and Small.



Test First Programming: 

In test first programming, you write tests before you even write any code.

The development of a single function proceeds in this order:

1. Spec : Write a specification for the function

2. Test : Write tests that exercise the specification

3. Implement : Write the actual code



### The specification (spec)
The specification (spec) describes the input and output behavior of the function.
In code, the specification consists of the ***method signature*** and the ***comment above it that describes what it does***.
