## Specification
A ***specification*** is like a contract for part of your program
○ saying what it can count on from the rest of the program,
○ and what it’s expected to do in return

A specification of a method consists of two clauses:
○ a ***precondition***, indicated by the keyword requires
○ a ***postcondition***, indicated by the keyword effects


## Invariants
An ***invariant*** is a condition that is guaranteed to be ***true*** during code execution.



For example, SLList with Sentinel Node has the following invariants:
○ sentinel instance variable always points to a sentinel node
○ the first node, if it exists, is always at sentinel.next
○ size instance variable is always the total number of items added
