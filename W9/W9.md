## Defensive programming
Two general ways to avoid painful debugging:
***Make bugs impossible by design***
***Localize bugs to a small part of the program***

### Assertions
This approach abstracts away from what exactly happens when the assertion fails.
â—‹ he failed assert might exit, might record an event in a log file, r might even email a report to a maintainer

assert (x >= 0) : "x is " + x;
If x == 1 , then this assertion fails with the error message: x is 1.

## assert is differ with JUnit:
The assert statement should be used in implementation code for defensive checks inside the implementation.
JUnit assert...() methods should be used in JUnit tests to check the result of a test.
