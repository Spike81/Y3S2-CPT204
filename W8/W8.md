## Three dimensions for comparing specs:
***deterministic***: a single possible output? or a set of legal outputs (***underdetermined***)?
***declarative***: characterize what the output should be? or explicitly say how to compute the output (***operational***)?
***strong***: does the spec have a small set of legal implementations, or a large set?

A specification S2 is stronger than or equal to a specification S1 if:
○ S2's precondition is weaker than or equal to S1's, and
○ S2's postcondition is stronger than or equal to S1's for the states that satisfy S1's precondition
and it's safe to replace S1 with S2 in your program

Diagraming Specification:
when S2 is stronger than S1:
